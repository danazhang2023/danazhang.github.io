Welcome to my website. My name is Zhang Jin, and I hold a Master's degree from Beijing Normal University and a Bachelor's degree from Dalian Nationalities University. Currently, I am a lecturer at Shandong University of Management. My research interests include digital communication technologies, social network analysis, and the dynamics of online echo chambers. I also teach Social Media Analysis, where I integrate computational methods and Python programming to enrich my undergraduates' learning experiences.I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of these critical areas and their implications in our interconnected world.
