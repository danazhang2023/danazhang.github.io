Welcome to my website. My name is Zhang Jin, and I hold a Master's degree from Beijing Normal University and a Bachelor's degree from Dalian Nationalities University. Currently, I am a lecturer at Shandong University of Management. My research interests primarily revolve around the fields of Political Communication, Social Network Analysis, Network Dynamics, and the study of Fake News and Misinformation in the digital age. I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of these critical areas and their implications in our interconnected world.
