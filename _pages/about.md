Welcome to my website. My name is Zhang Jin, and I hold a Master's degree from Beijing Normal University and a Bachelor's degree from Dalian Nationalities University. Currently, I am a lecturer at Shandong University of Management. My research interests primarily revolve around the fields of Political Communication, Social Network Analysis, Network Dynamics, and the study of Fake News and Misinformation in the digital age. I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of these critical areas and their implications in our interconnected world.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
